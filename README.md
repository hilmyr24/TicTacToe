# TicTacToe React Js
Simple TicTacToe game using React.js

This is my first time learning react.js and making simple code game TicTacToe.
I learn from react docs, and yes while i'm learning it's makes me somehow happy and somehow learn react is challanging for me.
I know is simple and small matters to the reader (yes it's you the reader) but for me it's small step to be better at programming specially react.js.
I hope from here, i can be better at this. 

Maybe ill improve this simple code to more complex later and better but dunno when, welp.
Thank you for reading and have a nice day to you
